Symbolic Calculator GUI
This is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing symbolic calculations using the SymPy library. 
You can use it to solve equations, perform algebraic operations, create and display plots, and more.

Author - Jan Beres

Features
Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Exponentiation and square root.
Symbolic variable input (x, y, z, s, t).
Equation solving for x, y, and z.
Symbolic integration and differentiation with respect to x, y, and z.
Expression expansion.
Plotting functions of x.
Graphical user interface for ease of use.
A fun "komplemencik" button!


Requirements
Python 3.11 or 3.10
SymPy library (install it using pip install sympy)
Matplotlib library (for plotting, install it using pip install matplotlib)
Tkinter (usually included with Python)


How to Use
Clone this repository or download the source code.
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Install the required SymPy and Matplotlib libraries using pip:
pip install sympy matplotlib
Run the script:
python symbolic_calculator.py
The GUI application will open.
Use the buttons to enter expressions and perform various symbolic calculations.
You can solve equations for x, y, and z, integrate and differentiate expressions, and more.


Notes
This calculator is intended for educational purposes and may not handle all possible inputs or edge cases.
The "komplemencik" button is for fun and doesn't perform any specific calculation.
